# Aubrey Voice Recognition

###About
Aubrey is a voice recognizing web app (hopefully soon to be an AI ) inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S from iron man!

### Goals for the project
- Weather
- character sheets
- and more
- more dice

###Current features:
- d20 dice roll done.
- d6 dice roll done.
- basic social conversational interaction.



Note: you will need a webserver to run Aubrey. I recommend the node module simple, npm install simple.
