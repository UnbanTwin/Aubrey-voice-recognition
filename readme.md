# Aubrey Voice Recognition

###About
Aubrey is a voice recognizing web app (hopefully soon to be an AI ) inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S from iron man!





Note: you will need a webserver to run Aubrey. I recommend the node module simple, npm install simple.
Edited note: you only need the webserver if you are going to make changes, otherwise just open up client.html
